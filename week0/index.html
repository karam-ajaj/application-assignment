  <strong>The Beatles</strong> were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.<br> With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band.<br> Rooted n skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.<br> In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania"; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s. The Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player.<br> The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962.<br> Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding the group's popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962.<br> They acquired the nickname "the Fab Four" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the next year, and by early 1964 became international stars, leading the "British Invasion" of the United States pop market.<br> From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (also known as the White Album, 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). <br>

  <strong>John Ono Lennon</strong> (legally John Winston Ono Lennon) was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist who co-founded the Beatles.<br> Born and raised in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager.<br> In 1957, he formed his first band, the Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960.<br> Lennon began to record as a solo artist before the band's break-up in April 1970; two of those songs were "Give Peace a Chance" and "Instant Karma!" Lennon subsequently produced albums that included John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine, and songs such as "Working Class Hero", "Imagine" and "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)".<br> After he married Yoko Ono in 1969, he added "Ono" as one of his middle names.<br> Lennon disengaged himself from the music business in 1975 to raise his infant son Sean, but re-emerged with Ono in 1980 with the album Double Fantasy.<br>

  A lone gunman shot and killed Lennon in the archway of his Manhattan apartment building three weeks after the album was released.<br> Lennon revealed a rebellious nature and acerbic wit in his music, writing, drawings, on film and in interviews.<br> Controversial through his political and peace activism, he moved from London to Manhattan in 1971, where his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a lengthy attempt by the Nixon administration to deport him.<br> Some of his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture.<br> By 2012, Lennon's solo album sales in the United States had exceeded 14 million units.<br> He is responsible for 25 number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart as a writer, co-writer, or performer.<br> In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons and in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time.<br> In 1987, he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Lennon was twice posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame—first in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again in 1994 as a solo artist.<br>

  <strong>Sir Richard Starkey</strong> (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles.<br> He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including "With a Little Help from My Friends", "Yellow Submarine", "Good Night", and their cover of "Act Naturally".<br> He also wrote the Beatles' songs "Don't Pass Me By" and "Octopus's Garden", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including "What Goes On" and "Flying".<br> Starr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations.<br> In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer.<br> Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre.<br> In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.<br> When the Beatles were formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes.<br> After achieving moderate success with that band in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, when he replaced Pete Best.<br>
  <img class="left" src="https://image.ibb.co/jpcEVx/ringo2.jpg" alt="ringo2"> Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others.<br> After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number four hit "It Don't Come Easy", and number ones "Photograph" and "You're Sixteen".<br> In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, "Back Off Boogaloo", which peaked at number two.<br> He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top ten release in both the UK and the US.<br> He has been featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows.<br> He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme Thomas & Friends and portrayed "Mr Conductor" during the first season of the PBS children's television series Shining Time Station.<br> Since 1989, he has toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.<br> Starr's creative contribution to music has received praise from other drummers such as Phil Collins, who described him as "a great musician", and Steve Smith, who commented: "Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song".<br> He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1998.<br> In 2011, Rolling Stone readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time.<br> Starr, who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Beatle in 1988, was inducted for his solo career in 2015, making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once.<br> He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.<br>
